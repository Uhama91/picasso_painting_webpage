# Picasso Painting Recreation with CSS

This repository is a visual project, recreating Picasso's art style using only HTML and CSS. It's a hands-on exercise inspired and guided by Free Code Camp's Intermediate CSS challenge.

## Overview

The project consists of an HTML file that sets up various divs and classes, representing different parts of a painting, such as characters, musical notes, and other visual elements. The CSS file then styles these elements, positioning them in a manner that mimics Picasso's unique art style.

The primary objective is to deepen the understanding of CSS properties, such as positioning, colors, and shapes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Shapes & Colors:** The artwork consists of various geometric shapes like triangles and circles, combined with a wide array of colors to give it depth and personality.

- **Complex Positioning:** To align each element accurately on the canvas, complex positioning techniques are employed.

- **Icon Integration:** FontAwesome icons are used to represent musical notes, adding a touch of modernism to the artwork.

## How to View

To see the Picasso painting recreation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML file in a browser.

## Dependencies

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/): For rendering music icons.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of CSS and how, with a bit of creativity, even a web styling language can be used for art. While this project focuses on Picasso's style, the techniques applied can be adapted to various other forms of art.
